Internet Application Development: Final Project
Created a web application using Python, HTML, and CSS for a NoSQL database (in Mongo) that satisfied 
the requirements of a pharmaceutical company performing clinical trials on new drugs.

Thatâ€™s a total of 7 different web pages:
1.studyA.py
2.addB.py
3.subjectC.py
4.commentD.py
5.visitE.py
6.deleteF.py
7.insertG.py

Using python and mongo, create a web interface that provides:
1. A study page (studyA.py) that lists all of the subjects (one per line) in the database.
2. A page (addB.py) that allows the user to add a new subject.
3. A subject page (subjectC.py) that lists all of the subject information from DM (demographics) for one subject.
4. A comment page (commentD.py) that lists all of the CO information for a particular subject.
5. A subject visit page (visitE.py) that lists all of the SV information for a particular subject.
6. Provide a delete page (deleteF.py) that deletes all documents in all collections.
7. Provide an insert page (insertG.py) that populates all of the collections with documents; It should insert at least 12 subject, 18 comments, and 20 visits.
